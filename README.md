# Creative Coding with Processing

The workshop will introduce you to creative coding using Processing.  Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.  You will learn how to create interactive graphics while being introduced to the fundamentals of computer programming.  

If who wish to participate should have Processing installed on their computer before arriving.  It is available as a free download from Processing's website [here](processing.org/download).

If you cannot install it, you can work with the web editor found [here](hello.processing.org/editor).
